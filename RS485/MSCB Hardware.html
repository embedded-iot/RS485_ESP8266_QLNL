Several prototypes modules have been developed at PSI. This page summarizes their features and
contains the schematics and PCB layout necessary to build these modules. The supplied
"software" in form of schematics and layouts is goverend by the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU public license</a>, which means that one can freely

produced by the P-CAD system.<p>

</p><hr><a name="bus"><h2>RS-485 Bus</h2>

The MSCB system uses the RS-485 bus as a physical mediumin half duplex mode. This bus uses a ground line and two
wires (A and B) which carry a differential signal to minimize the influence of noise. In the
MSCB system, the bus also carries three power lines (for +5V, +12V and -12V supply) and four
general purpose digital lines, which are application specific. The bus uses a 10-wire flat
ribbon cable with crimp connectors. Following figure shows the pin assignment on the bus:<p>

</p><center><table border="1">

<tr><td colspan="10" align="center"><img src="./MSCB Hardware_files/connector.gif"></td></tr>
</tbody></table></center></a><p><a name="bus">

The RS-485 bus is used in many industrial applications and other field buses. Some nice
introduction can be found </a><a href="http://www.bb-europe.com/bb-euro/literature/485appnote.pdf">here</a> and <a href="http://www.engineerbob.com/rs485.pdf?10,17">here</a>.</p><p>

Due to the differential signalling, it is relatively immune to noise when using twisted pair
cables. Depending on the speed, the bus can easily be run at distances from 100m to a few km.
If the bus becomes long (&gt; serveral hundred meters), a bus termination is required which
matches the impedance of the twisted pair cable. The bus runs at a speed of 345600 Baud but
can be slowed down if necessary. Unlike the RS-232 standard, the RS-485 is a multi-drop
half-duplex bus, which means that many nodes can be connected to the same bus, but only one node at
a time can send data. The RS-485 tranceivers in the SCS100 and SCS101 nodes present "1/8 load"
to the bus, which means that 256 nodes can be directly connected to the same bus segment. If
more nodes are needed, repeaters have to be used.</p><p>

It should be noted that the MSCB bus only needs the A,B and GND wires to function, if the node
power is supplied locally, and the interrupt and reset functionality is not necessary. In this
case, simple two wire shielded twisted pair cable can be used. It is then recommended to use
opto-couplers after the RS-485 transceivers to avoid ground loops.</p><p>

In order to set the A and B line to a defined level in case no node is active, two pull up / pull
down resistors are required. These resistors, together with a 100 Ohm termination resistor,
are per definition implemented at that point where the power is applied to the bus, to avoid
double termination as shown in the following figure:</p><p>

</p><center><img src="./MSCB Hardware_files/term.gif"></center><p>

When looking at the RS-485 line "A" (pin 1) with a scope, following bit pattern can be seen:</p><p>

</p><center><img src="./MSCB Hardware_files/bits.gif"></center><p>

After a negative start bit, we have 8 data bits with the LSB first, positive logic. The bit 9 is set
only in addressing commands, followed by a positive stop bit. Line "B" is inverted.</p><p>

</p><hr><a name="sm1"><h2>Submaster SCS-SM1</h2>

In principle one could use a simple RS232-RS485 converter to talk to the MSCB bus from a PC. The problem
lies in the usage of bit 9 of the RS232 protocol. It is not possible to switch this bit on and off fast
enough in the UART of the PC. In addition, the 8051 microcontrollers support bit rates not in common
with standard PC bit rates like 345600 baud. A further problem lies in the transmission of large data
buffers. While modern UARTs have usually a 16 byte FIFO, one might still get a buffor overrun if large
data buffers are received at high bit rates. To overcome this problems, the so-called "submaster" SM1
has been developed. It connects to the parallel port of the PC and to the MSCB bus on the other side. It
contains its own microcontroller which handles the handshake with the PC and features large enough
buffers to avoid data loss. To decouple the MSCB bus from the PC ground, all bus signals use
optocouplers.<p>

In addition the SM1 module contains a power supply which can be used to power 10-20 nodes on the bus.
Three unregulated voltages of +6V, +15V and -15V are supplied, so that small 78L05 type regulators
can be used on the nodes to produce a clean +5V power supply.</p><p>

A front panel button can be used to distribute an interrupt signal to all nodes on the bus, which
can be used for example to switch of high voltages in an emergency case. Since this button is
directly connected to a dedicated bus line, it works even if the microcontroller of the SM1 is
malfunctioning.</p><p>

As a starting point, a general purpose node using the Analog Devices ADuC812 microcontroller has been
designed. This node contains the RS485 bus receiver, +5V, +12V and -12V voltage regulators, a quartz,
and LED, a temperature sensor (LM35) and an interface connector to the SCS-LCD1 module which can also be
used to program the microcontroller. Since the microcontroller's ADC and DAC units have a range of
0..2.5V, two quad operation amplifiers are contained on the node which can be programmed for any gain
and offset in the range of -12V to +12V. In addition, the amplifiers can be configured as low pass
filters for noisy input signals. A prototype area is supplied for futher extensions like relais or
optocouplers.<p>

The SCS101 node is similar to the SCS100 node, except that it misses the space for the
operational amplifiers and the prototype grid. It is ment for piggy-back applications where
the board can be plugged onto a larger board, or for applications where the DAC/ADC range of
0..2.5V is sufficient.<p>

</p><hr></a><a name="hv"><h2>High voltage node</h2>

For several experiments at our institute, we need hundreds of cheap high voltate (0..2500V)
channels to drive photomultipliers. Therefore a new system based on the MSCB has been
developed. It uses special nodes with the ADuC812 microcontroller, a RS-485 tranceiver and
optocouplers to regulate an external voltage down to zero. Therefore, all channels can use a
single powerful high voltage source, and regulate the voltage down to the necessary value for
the different photomultipliers. Using two quad optocouplers in series, each with collector-
emmiter voltage of max. 200V, one can regulate voltages from 0..1600V. Using three quad
optocouplers one reaches 0..2400V. Since each channel contains its own microcontroller with
dedicated ADC and DAC channels, one can implement drift corrections and temperature
compensations in software running on the microcontrollers. The channels are directly connected
to the MSCB bus and can be controlled by the SCS-SM1 submaster.<p>

A motherboard houses 12 channels and a 19" crate houses 16 boards, which makes 192 channels
for a 19" crate. Each channel is connected to a LED on the fron panel for status display and
to a HV connector at the back plane.</p><p>

To compensate for temperature drifts in the DAC/ADC, a global high accuracy reference voltage
is distributed through the crate, which is measured at every node. This allows a software
correction for various drifts. In addition to that, the integrated temperature sensor of the
microcontroller is used to compensate temperature drifts of some resistors.</p><p>

The development of this system is still in progress so the quoted numbers are preliminary.</p><p>

<h3>General purpose node with Cygnal C8051F000</h3>

This node will be similar to the SCS100, but using the Cygnal microcontroller, which is
better suited for application development due to its JTAG debug and download interface. This
microcontroller can also be reprogrammed over the MSCB bus.<p>

</p><h3>Submaster without power supply</h3>

This will be a small submaster similar to the SCS-SM1, but without an integrated power supply.
Instead, it will be powered directly from the bus. This module will be used together with the
